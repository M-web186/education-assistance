# Education Assistance

**Education Assistance** helps students plan their studies and choose learning methods using AI. It makes learning easier by recommending the best strategies for each student.

## Features

- **Personal Study Plans:** AI creates a study plan based on your goals and learning style.
- **Learning Method Advice:** Get simple tipsâ€”visual (videos, diagrams), auditory (audio, discussion), reading/writing, or hands-on activities.
- **Easy-to-Understand Content:** Get summaries and resources tailored to how you learn best.
- **Progress Tracking:** See your progress and adjust your plan anytime.

## How It Works

1. Tell the AI your subjects, goals, and how you like to learn.
2. Get a custom plan and method suggestions (visual, auditory, etc.).
3. Follow your plan and use suggested resources.
4. Give feedback so the AI can improve your plan.

## Example

- **Visual:** Watch videos and use diagrams.
- **Auditory:** Listen to recordings or join discussions.
- **Kinesthetic:** Do hands-on activities.
- **Reading/Writing:** Read materials and take notes.
